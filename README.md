# Features

## Incremental flight
When you first vist the experience, you will see that the birds start perched, and then one by one begin to fly. I did this to give the simulation a more natural feeling.

## Perching Extension
I added an extension to my simulation where birds perch during a time interval, but you can also force all the birds to perch with a button.

## Procedural poles and wires
The last extension I worked on are entirley procedurally generated poles and wires. These also determine the starting location of all the birds.
